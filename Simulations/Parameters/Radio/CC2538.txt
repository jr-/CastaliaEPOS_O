RX MODES
# Name, dataRate(kbps), modulationType, bitsPerSymbol, bandwidth(MHz), noiseBandwidth(KHz), noiseFloor(dBm), sensitivity(dBm), powerConsumed(mW)
normal, 250, PSK, 4, 20, 194, -100, -97, 60

# Note: PSK == OQPSK (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/castalia-simulator/jM8WOhrk7uc):

# Yes, ODPSK has the same SNR-to-bit-error-probability function with what we call PSK  which essentially is BPSK or DPSK (the two are equivalent). The ODPSK is just a variant that does not change the modulation curve.

# Note that DiffBPSK and DiffQPSK are different and we have dedicated modulation types for these in Castalia.
